# Brainstorm-trial-averaging
The script allows to create averages from ordered chunks of single epochs. It does so by condition, no matter if the number of trials differs. The maximum difference between averages in the number of trials they contain is 1.

It is possible to specify the maximum number of averages created in the variable <b>nChunks</b>.

Al the averages are then put in a separate folder named "Chunks".

Have fun!
